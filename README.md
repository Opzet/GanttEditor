CRUD operations can be configured in Gantt Chart using GanttEditSettings and AllowTaskbarEditing. Gantt Chart has two Mode to manipulate the datasource

In this demo, Auto mode is enabled for editing. On the TreeGrid side, you can start editing any row by double-clicking on it or clicking on the toolbarâ€™s Edit button. Then, the currently selected row will be changed to edit state. On the Chart side, you can edit the tasks using the edit dialog by double-clicking on the taskbars and also you can edit the dependency connector lines using drag and drop action with connector line points available on either side of the parent taskbar, child taskbar, and milestones.

When the taskbar and connector point is dragged, the viewport shows left and right edges and the top and bottom edges, which automatically initiate horizontal and vertical scrolling.

To learn more about CRUD operations and managing tasks, refer to documentation section.
